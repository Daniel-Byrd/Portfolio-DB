		<button type="button" class="ColButton">Data Analysis Project: TF2 Map Analysis</button>
		<div class="CollapseSection">
			<p>This was a project to help keep skills that I recently learned sharp and to apply them to something I had genuine curiosity about.</p>
			<p>To those who do not know, Team Fortress 2 (TF2), is a first person shooter created by Valve in 2007 and is host to a number of maps.  A lot of these maps are actually made by members of the community, and is still updated (somewhat) to this day.  I had a few questions I wanted to ask that seemed best to answer through data analysis and as such, begun working.</p>
			<p>First step of the project was data collection, I got majority of data from official TF2 wiki page, which has every map listed there.  I also followed a process labeled by Youtuber Uncle Dane on how to get the rough playable space of all of these maps and created my own data set to work with.</p>
			<p>After gathering all of the data, I put it all into Python, and begun to create various charts and visualizations to show off my findings.  At first I was creating the charts using matplotlib, but decided to move to Dash and Plotly as those would allow me to put my findings on a website and still retain interactability.</p>
			<p>You can access the completed project with fully interactable charts by using the following link: </p>
			<p><a href="https://tf2mapanalysis2023.onrender.com" target="_blank">https://tf2mapanalysis2023.onrender.com</a></p>
			<p><i>*Please note that due to the hosting system used, the page can take up to 2 minutes to initially load, please give it some time if the site gives you a blank page at first</i></p>
			<p>The plan for this project also involved making similar reports within both Excel and Looker Studio.</p>
			<p>You can view the excel file version, which also includes the data used for this project here: </p>

		<button type="button" class="ColButton">Data Analysis Project: Bad Apple Word Cloud</button>
		<div class="CollapseSection">
			<p>This was an idea I had gotten while learning how to visualize data in Python.  Using the Wordcloud library, you can use a black and white image (Or really just any image that is just a single color with a empty background) as a mask for the word cloud to fit inside of.</p>
			<p>The core idea of the project was to take every frame from the music video Bad Apple, which is already in black and white, and apply a word cloud to every frame.  From here, I can stitch the frames back together and render it back into a proper video.</p>
			<p>The end result was 6,953 word cloud images being created, all of which were made by the program I created running a single time.</p>
			<p>You can view the end results of this project by looking at the attached Youtube link</p>
			<iframe width="420" height="345" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VGfdpqpR-RM"></iframe>

		<button type="button" class="ColButton">Portfolio Website</button>
		<div class="CollapseSection">
			<p>The website you are currently seeing has actually gone through a few iterations.  I actually originally used the same website layout I had used for my final project in the Web Design class in college, but decided to create a new design now that I have more time on my hands.</p>
			<p>A goal I had when creating the site was to have everything appear under the main outline.  This means that I could not allow the entire page to scroll, leaving me with the option to have just a single section of a 3 column layout available for scrolling.</p>
			<p>One thing that actually took a while was trying to get the general layout of the site down.  I ended up having to make a test version with more distinct colors in each section just so I can better troubleshoot the thousands of issues I ended up creating along the way.</p>
			<p>One thing I had got working on an older version of the site was a short animation that would play when your first enter the site.  It was to resemble an old TV turning on.  While it was mostly functional, there were some minor issues with alignment that needed consideration.
			I would also have needed to put in a way to prevent the animation from playing when selecting the links on the side (Otherwise it would appear every time you changed page, which would be highly annoying).</p>
			<p>The website itself is still a in-progress thing, as I will slowly over time add more to it, fix the many issues with its layout and update it will the various projects I have worked on.
			I already know that I plan on working on a more mobile friendly version of the site, and creating a system that should allow it to switch between mobile and desktop version automatically.</p>
			<p>As with any website, this one was created using a mixture of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

		<button type="button" class="ColButton">Zombie Game 5012</button>
		<div class="CollapseSection">
			<p>A project I decided to work on in high-school purely out of boredom one day.  The idea was to replicate the style of game found in the zombies mode of Call Of Duty, but put it in a top down perspective (ignoring the fact that Call Of Duty has actually done this...sorta).</p>
			<p>A main goal was to create a system that would both slowly increase the amount of zombies that spawn, while also making them more durable as the waves increases.</p>
			<p>A major challenge I had to overcome was figuring out how to allow zombies to spawn in areas that the player just unlocked, and while the solution was not elegant, it works.</p>
			<p>The game was made in GameMaker Studio, and while I never did get around to properly finishing it, I am still proud of the progress made on it.</p>

		<div class="CollapseSection">
			<p>Either during down-time at work, or during my own free time, I often find myself drawing random things and concepts.</p>
			<p>While most of the drawings are help learn and practice, there are a few drawings I have made that I have planned to use in other personal projects.</p>
			<p>The tools I have used for drawings range widely from something as bare-bones as Microsoft Paint, to more complex programs such as Krita and Aseprite.</p>

		<button type="button" class="ColButton">3D Modeling</button>
		<div class="CollapseSection">
			<p>While I had done art for a while now, I have never really dabbled in the 3D aspect of art too much.  The only exception was an animation class that I took back in high school, where we used Autodesk Maya to create a few animations.  I never really continued using Maya on my own, mainly due to the cost associated with the program itself.</p>
			<p>Back around 2019/2020, I learned of a free alternative to Maya: Blender, which I started to slowly learn and practice in.  I had also learned of the program MagicaVoxel, a 3D art program used to create voxel based images (Think pixel art, but in a 3D space).</p>
			<p>While I am very much new to 3D modeling, there have been a few models that I am rather proud of, even managing to get a few of them fully rigged and modded into other games.</p>
			<p>As mentioned before, the programs used or either Blender, or MagicaVoxel.</p>

		<button type="button" class="ColButton">Game Modding</button>
		<div class="CollapseSection">
			<p>When it comes to certain video games, they have the ability to be edited by the user.  This is usually referred to as modding.</p>
			<p>Examples of games that I had created mods for are: Don't Stare (Both the singleplayer version of the multiplayer version), Spelunky, Noita, and VRChat (Sorta)</p>
			<p>In two of the four examples, the mods themselves are rather simple, they are just replacing one image with another, but the process of doing so can take a surprisingly large amount of time (and in the case of the Spelunky mod, I cheated by just recoloring an image)</p>
			<p>In the case of Don't starve, the mod itself allows for each character to have different abilities.  Most characters would usually have a mixture of positive and negative quirks to keep things balanced.  In my mod, I made it so the player would passively regen their sanity stat, but also loose it at a faster rate</p>
			<p>VrChat is an odd case of modding.  As it currently stands, modding the actual game goes against their terms of service.  However, they have a system in place that allows users to create and upload their creations directly onto the platform.  This will either be in the form of avatars or worlds.</p>
			<p>The progrmas used in the screenshots below are Aseprite, Blender, Unity, and Visual Studio (using C#)</p>

			<p>Listing this as such because I have yet to figure out what I want to call this project.  This one has been something I have wanted to work on for a while now, but never found the time or motivation to.
			The game would be a first person action/adventure game that plays similarly to games such as Metroid Prime and Doom Eternal.
			The player would slowly explore a large map, gaining more upgrades and abilities as they explore and fight enemies.</p>
			<p>So far the project is still in its concept stage, with my planning on how things will look, how the world will be shaped, and how the game itself should be played.</p>
