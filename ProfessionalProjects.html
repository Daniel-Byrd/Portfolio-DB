		<button type="button" class="ColButton">Pomeroy: UMB Work Notes Site</button>
		<div class="CollapseSection">
			<p>During my first weeks with Pomeroy, I had noticed that the main way the team had organized tickets was via text files that would be copy and pasted onto Service Now.
			Wanting a more efficient way of getting this information organized, I created a website that can allow the user to easily record the needed info, then copy it into a format that would be used for ticket/incident logs.
			The website also came with a few work note templates that can be used for some of the more common issues the users face.
			I would later add the storage site to this as well, a means of recording previous incident descriptions (but sadly not saving the work notes that were created).</p>
			</p>As with any website, this was made using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

			<p>There are two versions of the Budget Ninjas website: The newer mobile friendly version and the older classic design. 
			While the newer design is mobile friendly it is missing some of the features from the classic page. One such feature was the ability to check the more specific details of expenses and incomes and to even possibly change them or undo said changes. 
			Tools used were Visual Studio 2019 using Telerik controls on classic ASPX pages with C# code behind.</p>

			I was also tasked with creating an entirely new type of page for the mobile site, which would act as a template for further news stories.

		<div class="CollapseSection">
			<p>A group project with the main goal of creating a board game using javaFX. 
			Our group chose checkers due to its simple nature, which would prove helpful considering the other projects that also needed attention to at the time. 
			The core part of the program was formed together from a group members discovery of an already existing javaFX checkers game. 
			This base however, was very incomplete, leaving us to learn to study it, learn how it works, then fix it, and get it working. 
			We used this already existing game as a basis for our own, expanding upon it and adding needed features that were not already present. 
			The end result of this project was a rather plain looking but functional game of checkers. 
			The tool used for this project was jGRASP.</p>
